		<p>As I announced in class earlier this week, there is a take-home makeup for quiz 6. If you weren't in class today, please email me to get a copy of it. The due date for the makeup quiz is Monday before the final. You are not allowed to consult with anyone on the quiz.</p>

		<p>Saturday afternoon, we will have another review session. The IC is closed, so let's meet in the math lounge (Padelford C-130). Here are some quick <a href="info/mathlounge-directions.pdf" target="_blank">directions</a>.</p>

		<p>Calculators will be allowed on the final. Scientific calculators are OK; graphing calculators and cell phones are not. If you don't have a
basic/scientific calculator, try to find someone who can loan you one,
and if that fails, talk to me.</p>

		<p>The review sessions for the final will be this Friday in the IC math room: 11:30&ndash;12:15 and 1:45&ndash;5:30(ish).</p>

		<p>Our final exam period is officially two hours long (8:30-10:30), but we actually have a four-hour-long period since we meet daily. So on Monday, although I will write a 2-hour final, you'll have an extra two hours or so to finish the final.</p>

		<p>Finally, the last day to turn in late homework is this Friday (3/9).</p>
