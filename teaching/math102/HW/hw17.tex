\textbf{Assignment 17} (due 2/8)


46 V,  VI(a, b, g, h only),  VII

48 III, V


In class, I wrote exercise set 47 instead of 48 by accident. This is the correct assignment.

{\itshape (Note that the numbering on 46 may be off in your book. The fifth
problem in the section (which asks ``Simplify the following radicals'')
should be numbered V, not VI. Similarly, the next two problems should be
labeled VI and VII instead of VII and VIII.)}
