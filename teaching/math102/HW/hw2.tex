\textbf{Assignment 2}: Exercise Set 30, IIa--g, plus a quick survey

Solve the following equations for $y$ (don't forget to check your solutions):

\begin{tabular}{r<{.}>{$}l<{$}r<{.}>{$}l<{$}}
a       & 3x=12-3y  &  \hspace*{1in}   b & x+6y=0\\
c & x+2y=4 & d & x+y=0\\
e&2y-x=6&f&6x+2=3y-1\\
g&3y=6-x
\end{tabular}

\textit{Survey:}

These questions are to help me get a better idea of how you learn best. They're not for a grade.

\begin{itemize}
\item How well-prepared do you feel for Math 102?
\item What have your past math teachers done that has helped you learn the most?
\item What was the last math course you took, and when?
\end{itemize}
