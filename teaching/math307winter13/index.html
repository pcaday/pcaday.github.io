              One student noticed that the rule I gave for finding the constants for an irreducible quadratic factor is completely wrong. Here's the correct version. Suppose you have an irreducible quadratic factor in your partial fraction expansion:

To find A and B you'll cover up ((s-a)<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>) in the denominator like usual, and plug in s = a + bi. The result will be another complex number, say c + di. Then you can find A and B from c and d as follows: A is d/sqrt(b), while B = c.

              In preparation for the second midterm (which is next Wednesday,
              February 27), we'll have a review session, like we did for the
              first midterm. We'll meet <b>Monday 4:30 &ndash; 6:00</b>,
              location TBD.

              Let me know if there's a particular topic you'd like to have more
              review on, or if you have suggestions on the format of the
              session. I'm thinking of doing either a Q &amp; A style session,
              or handing out a practice midterm for everyone to work on
              individually (like last time). Send me an email if you have an

            <p>
              Another one of the 307 instructors, Gautam Sisodia, wrote several
              applets which graph the solutions of homogeneous and
              nonhomogeneous second-order constant coefficient linear ODEs.
            </p>
            <p>
              These applets allow you to change the coefficients of the
              equations and see visually how it affects the solution. In the
              nonhomogeneous applet, the external force is a trig function
              (like we've considered in class). I'd highly recommend taking a
              look at them. Here are the links:
            </p>
            <ul class="invisible">
              <li>
                <a href=

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In both applets, the sliders at the bottom control the
              parameters. Watch the equation to see which sliders control which
              parameters, and then see how that affects the solution.

              been a couple issues on the assignment and most importantly I
              wasn't able to cover the topics of quasi-periods and
              quasi-frequency last Friday as I was hoping. As a result, it will
              not be due with this week's homework; I'll put it on next week's
              homework (which will be due Monday, February 25). I also removed
              one of the ungraded problems (3.7 #18)
            </p>
            <p>
              The other issue is that it was pointed out that the second
              pendulum in problem 1 is overdamped. When I post homework 5, I'll
              include a corrected version of the problem.

            <p>
              Part (a) is really separate from the rest of problem 6. In part
              (a), we're imagining that we drop an object from a height h, and
              we want to show that the object's velocity just before it hits
              the ground is the square root of 2gh.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do that, we need a formula for the object's velocity, v(t),
              and we also need to know the time the object hits the ground so
              we can plug it into v(t). To find when the object hits the
              ground, it will be handy to have the formula for the object's
              position; let's call it y(t).
            </p>
            <p>
              For motion problems like this, we start with the forces on the
              object, which create acceleration. In our problem, the only force
              is gravity, and it causes an acceleration of a(t) = -g.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so to get v(t), we
              integrate: v(t) = &int;&nbsp;a(t) = -gt + c. To find c, we use
              the fact that the object starts with zero velocity: v(0) = 0, so
              c = 0. Similarly, since velocity is the derivative of position,
              we can now integrate v(t) to get y(t): y(t) = &int;&nbsp;v(t) =
              -gt<sup>2</sup>/2 + c. Now, since the object starts at height h,
              we get the initial condition y(0) = h, so c = h.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we have formulas for y(t) and v(t). To find when the object
              hits the ground, we can solve for when y(t) = 0. I'll let you
              finish it off from there.
            </p><!-- old note -->
            <!--
<p>Here's a quick note on problem 6a, section 2.3: The question is asking you to show that a particle dropped from height <i>h</i> will have velocity equal to the square root of <i>2gh</i> when it reaches the ground.</p>

<p>One way to solve this: start by deriving an equation for the height <i>y(t)</i> of the particle <i>t</i> seconds after it is dropped. With this equation, you can solve for the time it takes for the particle to reach the ground, and go from there.</p>

              Then, on Friday, we'll look at Euler's method for finding

              practical method for computing solutions to differential

            done in class &mdash; if you understand those well, you should be
            set for the quiz. You're allowed to use a double-sided page of

            <span class="announcetitle">Notes on Homework 1</span>
            <p>
              I've had a few questions on the homework that I think could use
              some explanation, so here are some pointers:
            </p><b>2.1, #24(c):</b>
            <p>
              The key thing to describe is the limit of the solution as t goes
              to zero, when a = 1/e. (In other words, find the value for your
              constant, c, that corresponds to the initial condition y(1) = a =
              1/e, and plug it into the general solution, then take the limit
              as t tends to 0).
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason a = 1/e is special is that for larger values of a, the
              solution y(t) tends to positive infinity as t -&gt; 0, and for
              smaller values of a, it tends to negative infinity as t -&gt; 0.
              Part (c) is asking you to investigate what happens right when a =
              1/e.
            </p><b>2.2, #21:</b>
            <p>
              You can leave your solution in implicit form (instead of solving
              for y, which would be a mess). As a rule, when solving separable
              equations, the solutions you get will be in implicit form, and
              it's OK to leave them that way, both on homework and on tests.
              The last part of this problem, which asks for the interval where
              the solution is defined, is a tricky point. <a href=
              "handouts/implicitSolutionsValidIntervals.pdf" target=

            either of these times, you're always welcome to meet with me
            another time&mdash; just email me or talk to me after class.
            Regular office hours begin next week. For now, we'll be meeting in
