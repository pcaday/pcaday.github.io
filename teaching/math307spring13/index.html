              started on another example with a system driven by a periodic

            <p>
              Today we began talking about the applications of second-order
              linear equations, and in particular the spring-mass setup, which
              was a simple model for different kinds of real-life oscillations.
              In this setup, a mass hangs from a spring, possibly experiencing
              some damping force due to air resistance, and possibly
              experiencing additional external forces from outside the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this class, we started analyzing the motion in this setup
              when there is no external force (unforced) and no damping
              (undamped). We started on an example with a verbal description of
              the system, first setting up an initial value problem then
              solving it. Finally, we started talking about how to convert the
              solution of the ODE into a more useful form (standard sinusoidal
              form). The standard sinusoidal form makes it easier to answer
              questions about the motion of the system, like how much the mass
              moves up and down, how quickly it oscillates, and when it first
              passes the equilibrium point. <a href=

            <p>
              In this class we talked about one problem that can come up with
              the method of undetermined coefficients the way we've done it up
              until now. As an example, we tried to solve
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>y''</i> - 3<i>y'</i> + 2<i>y</i> = <i>e<sup>t</sup></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the right-hand side, the trial solution should be
              <i>Y</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>Ae<sup>t</sup></i>, but if we plug this
              into the left-hand side, we get zero, not <i>e<sup>t</sup></i>.
              The problem is that <i>Ae<sup>t</sup></i> is a solution to the
              homogeneous equation <i>y''</i> - 3<i>y'</i> + 2<i>y</i> = 0. The
              solution is to modify the trial solution by multiplying
              <i>Ae<sup>t</sup></i> by <i>t</i> first.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general rule is: if X is a part of the trial solution that's
              also a solution to the homogeneous, then multiply X by <i>t</i>.
              If the trial solution also includes terms that are powers of
              <i>t</i> times X, they'll need to be multiplied by <i>t</i> also.
              For instance, if the homogeneous equation has
              <i>e<sup>t</sup></i> as a solution, and <i>Y</i>(<i>t</i>) =
              <i>Ae<sup>t</sup></i> + <i>Bte<sup>t</sup></i> +
              <i>Ct</i><sup>2</sup><i>e<sup>t</sup></i> + <i>D</i> , the
              <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> terms would each have to be
              multiplied by <i>t</i>. On the other hand, the <i>D</i> term we
              wouldn't touch, because it isn't a solution to the homogeneous
              equation.

              Today's class we recapped the process we use to find the trial
              solution <i>Y</i>(<i>t</i>) from the nonhomogeneous part of the
              equation. For the rest of class, we talked about how to find the
              general solution of a nonhomogeneous equation by adding one
              particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation to the general
              solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. For instance,
              if we're given the equation <i>y'' + 3y' + 2y = 4</i> to solve,
              the method of undetermined coefficients says that one solution is
              <i>Y</i>(<i>t</i>) = 2. The general solution to the corresponding
              homogeneous equation, <i>y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0</i>, is
              <i>y<sub>c</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>ce<sup>-t</sup></i> +
              <i>de<sup>-2t</sup></i>. Adding these two together will give us
              the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation:
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>Y</i>(<i>t</i>) +
              <i>y<sub>c</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>ce<sup>-t</sup></i> +
              <i>de<sup>-2t</sup></i> + 2.

              Today we had a quiz on SLHCCs, and then began talking about
              nonhomogeneous constant-coefficient equations, which look like
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>ay''</i> + <i>by'</i> + <i>cy</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>)
            </p>
            <p>
              where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are constants, and
              <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>) is a function.
            </p>
            <p>
              These often come up in motion problems when there is an external
              force applied to a system (or in circuit problems, where there is
              an external voltage source). We began talking about one way to
              solve these, the method of undetermined coefficients, which is an
              educated guess-and-check method. The idea with undetermined
              coefficients is to take the nonhomogeneous part of the equation
              (this is <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>), the part that doesn't involve
              <i>y</i> or its derivatives) and use it to guess what one
              solution to the equation looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our textbook covers undetermined coefficients in section 3.5. If
              you read it, you'll note the book has a different approach to
              finding the trial solution, where you look up the appropriate
              trial solution in a table. You're welcome to learn and use this
              approach in your work and on exams, but make sure to make a note
              of it if you do.

            <p>
              Today we talked about how to solve SLHCCs when the characteristic
              equation had roots that were complex numbers (they involve the
              imaginary number <i>i</i>). Complex numbers enter the scene when
              the discriminant, the number under the square root in the
              quadratic formula, is negative. To find the general solution in
              this case, we could still use the technique from Friday using
              <i>y</i> = <i>e<sup>rt</sup></i>, but we have to figure out what
              <i>e<sup>rt</sup></i> means when <i>r</i> is a complex number.
              Here Euler's formula comes in:
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>e<sup>iu</sup></i> = cos(<i>u</i>) + <i>i</i> sin(<i>u</i>)
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Euler's method, and by taking special linear combinations
              of the solutions, we found that if the roots are <i>r</i> =
              <i>a</i> + <i>bi</i>, <i>r</i> = <i>a</i> - <i>bi</i>, then the
              general solution can be written as <i>y</i> =
              <i>ce<sup>at</sup></i>cos(<i>bt</i>) +
              <i>de<sup>at</sup></i>sin(<i>bt</i>), where <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>
              are arbitrary constants. In the book, this is covered in section
              3.3.

            of Order</span>
            <p>
              Today we talked about how to solve 2nd-order linear homogeneous
              constant coefficient ODEs (SLHCCs for short) when the
              characteristic equation has a repeated root. Using the method
              from the last class (plugging in <i>y</i> = <i>e<sup>rt</sup></i>
              and solving for <i>r</i>) we only get one solution instead of two
              because of the repeated root (section 3.4 in the book).
            </p>
            <p>
              To find a second solution we tried a new technique called
              reduction of order, which is another substitution method. If
              <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>(t) is some function we already know is a
              solution to the ODE (<i>e<sup>rt</sup></i> in this case) then we
              substitute a new variable <i>v(t)</i> for <i>y</i>, which we do
              by plugging in <i>y</i> = <i>v(t)</i><i>y</i><sub>1</sub>(t).
              This gives us a new second-order ODE for <i>v(t)</i> that is
              easier to solve. Once we solve for <i>v(t)</i>, we can get a new
              solution <i>y(t)</i> for the original ODE by multiplying
              <i>v(t)</i> by <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>t</i>)

              Today, we found a quick formula for finding the integrating
              factor for a linear first-order ODE. Before, we had to solve
              another ODE (which was separable) to find the integrating factor.
              The book talks about this in section 2.1, on page 36.

            <p>
              Then, we talked about solving Bernoulli equations, which were
              nonlinear 1st-order equations which look like
              <i>p(t)y'</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>q(t)y</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>g(t)y<sup>n</sup></i>.
              To solve these, we used a substitution,
              <i>v(t)</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>y</i><sup>1-<i>n</i></sup>. This
              substitution transforms the Bernoulli equation into a linear ODE,
              which we now have to solve for <i>v(t)</i>. Once we know
              <i>v(t)</i>, we can undo the substitution to find <i>y(t)</i>.
              The book discusses Bernoulli equations in homework problems
              27&ndash;31 for section 2.4.

              We did a warm-up, reviewing the two techniques for solving
              first-order ODEs from the first week of class (separation of
              variables and integrating factors). Afterwards we began talking
              about applications of 1st-order ODEs, starting with mixing
              problems (section 2.3 in the textbook).

            <p>
              On Friday the plan is to have a short quiz on integrals (focusing
              on <i>u</i>-substitution and integration by parts, like the
              review problems). After the quiz, we can go on to solving
              1st-order linear equations and a new technique (integrating
              factors) which we can use to solve them.

              video</a> made by Nathan Grigg, another 307 instructor, which
              shows the process of solving 1st-order linear equations, so you
              can get a head start on Friday's class. Thanks Nathan!

            <p>
              We talked about different ways of classifying DEs: by order,
              ordinary vs. partial, single equations vs. systems, linear vs.
              nonlinear, and homogeneous vs. nonhomogeneous. The book discusses
              this in section 1.3, pages 19-21 (starting from "Classification
              of Differential Equations" and ending at figure 1.3.1). After
              that, we started talking about separable equations (section 2.2
              in the book) and did an example of solving them.

              We went over the <a href="handouts/syllabus.pdf" target=
              "_blank">syllabus</a> and talked about what differential
              equations are, why we study them, and did an example involving a
              falling object with drag. We also talked about using direction
              fields to visualize solutions to first-order ODEs. Some of the
              material you can find in the book, in section 1.1.
