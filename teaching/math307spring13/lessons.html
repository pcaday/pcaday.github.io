            <p>
              Today we started into the second major topic of the course:
              second order linear ODEs. We began by discussing some of the many
              applications of these equations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this lecture and the next two, we focus on solutions of
              <i>homogeneous</i> second order equations the form
              ay''&nbsp;+&nbsp;by'&nbsp;+&nbsp;cy&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. We found the
              general solution for these equations using the <i>characteristic
              equation</i>
              ar<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;br&nbsp;+&nbsp;c&nbsp;=&nbsp;0:
            </p>
            <p>
              y(t) = c<sub>1</sub>e<sup>r<sub>1</sub>t</sup> +
              c<sub>2</sub>e<sup>r<sub>2</sub>t</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              where r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub> were the solutions of the
              characteristic equation. This method works as long as the
              characteristic equation actually has two real roots. The other
              scenarios are the topic of the next two lectures.

              With many differential equations, we won't be able to find
              formulas for exact solutions. Today, we talked about Euler's
              method, which allows us to find approximate solutions to a
              differential equation, even if we can't solve it exactly. In our
              textbook, Euler's method is covered in section 2.7.

            <p>
              In this class we continued studying autonomous equations. We
              talked about stable and unstable equilibrium solutions and how to
              determine if a solution is stable or not (More examples are in
              section 2.5 in the book).

            Autonomous Equations</span>
            <p>
              We started with a quick discussion of some technical questions
              about differential equations. We asked whether every initial
              value problem has a solution, and if it does, must it have only
              one solution, or could there be several? We talked about this
              briefly; section 2.4 in the book goes into much greater detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the rest of class we covered <i>autonomous</i> or
              time-independent equations. These are equations where
              <i>dy/dt</i> depends only on <i>y</i> and not <i>t</i> (the
              dependent variable). For instance, <i>dy/dt = y<sup>2</sup></i> +
              1 is autonomous, while <i>dy/dt = y + t</i> is not. We started to
              discuss how we can understand solutions to autonomous equations
              graphically, without solving the differential equation, using
              phase lines and direction fields. Autonomous equations are
              covered in section 2.5 in our textbook.

            <p>
              In today's class we considered motion problems. In these
              problems, the main theme was converting an ODE involving two
              independent variables, time and position, into one involving only
              position. This involved a trick using the chain rule: dv/dt =
              (dv/dx)(dx/dt) = (dv/dx)v. For more information, you can take a
              look at example 4 in section 2.3.

            <p>
              This week we'll dive into more applications of 1st-order ODEs. In
              today's lecture, we looked at a mixing problem, where a chemical
              (or salt, or pollen &mdash; there are many possibilities) enters
              in and mixes with the contents of a tank (or pond, etc.) and
              leaves at a given rate. You can look at example 1 in section 2.3
              for another example of mixing problem. We also considered what
              happens when the chemical flows into the tank faster than it
              leaves, which doesn't seem to be covered in the book.

              of x). You can read more in section 2.2 in the book.
