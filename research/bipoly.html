<h1>Optimizing Polynomial Models of Algebraic Curves</h1>

<p>
In cryptographic applications, we are interested in elliptic curves that have a specified number of points. One way to do this involves an algebraic curve, the modular curve <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>N</i>) <sup>[1]</sup>. However, the polynomial defining <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>N</i>) may be extremely large, with tens of thousands of terms, say. Fortunately, to facilitate computations, it may be possible to find a change of coordinates that simplifies the polynomial considerably. 
</p>

<p>
In this project, my mentor Andrew V. Sutherland and I developed a non-deterministic algorithm, using simulated annealing, which searches for simpler polynomials by repeatedly applying a small set of atomic operations. Our algorithm matched and in many cases improved on previously known results, with very reasonable runtime: for instance, simplifying a polynomial with total degree 352 and 33,618 terms (representing <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>101</i>)) required less than 3 minutes on a standard desktop.
